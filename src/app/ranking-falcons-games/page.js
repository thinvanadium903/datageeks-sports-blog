                <h1>Analyzing the Falcons' 2024 Season</h1>
                <p>
                    As a fan of the Atlanta Falcons for the past 11 years, I have watched this 
                    team naivgate through uncharted waters before, but the Falcons are now doing 
                    something that as far as I can tell, is a first for this franchise in the 
                    21st century - spending big to get a quarterback in free agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Up to this point in the new millenium, the quarterback situation has looked 
                    like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
