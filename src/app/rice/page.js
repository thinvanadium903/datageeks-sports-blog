        <h1>The Unparalleled Career Dominance of Jerry Rice</h1>
        <p>In sports, there are many arguments - rational and otherwise - that fans and observers use to gauge
              who is the greatest player of all time in that sport. In basketball, the argument 
              largely hinges on individual "legacy", and said argument usually comes down to 
              2 players: LeBron James for his individual longevity and consistency, and Michael Jordan for
              his peak performance and the Bulls' phenomenal team success during his tenure.
        </p>
        <p>Other sports have far more subjective requirements. In soccer, baseball, hockey, and football, players
          hold more specialized roles within their teams, and this restriction makes comparisons between positions
          and eras much more difficult. As such, the discussion of "Greatest of All Time" is more or less limited to
          a specific position. In football, some positions such as running back have multiple players who lay claim to the throne. 
          Emmitt Smith is the NFL's leader in career rushing yardage, rushing attempts, and rushing touchdowns, but he enjoyed the benefits
          of having a historically dominant offensive line and great coaching scheme. Walter Payton is also in the 
          G.O.A.T conversation, having retired as the career leader in those statistics as well. Other players like Ladainian Tomlinson, 
          Eric Dickerson, Marshall Faulk, and Jim Brown have slightly less impressive career numbers, but boast arguably the
          greatest peak performances off all time, and whose legacies revolve around some of the most jaw-dropping seasons ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>The wide receiver position does not experience this dilemma; simply put, Jerry Rice has it all. In his gargantuan 20-season
          career, Rice combined elite, league-leading performance with a degree of longevity and durability that would be exceptional for a quarterback or kicker,
          let alone the brutally physical wide receiver position. His career statistics tower over every other player's REGARDLESS
          of position, and his legacy as an ultra-clutch playoff performer make him (arguably) the very greatest player in NFL history.
